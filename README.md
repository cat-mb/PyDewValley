**important** when downloading everything, you will have to make a new folder titled 'graphics' and put the following inside the folder: character, environment, fruit, objects, overlay, rain, soil, soil_water, stumps, water, world. Apologies about this! I couldnt upload the entire graphics folder since the file was too big, so I had to upload each item separately.

**controls**
arrow keys - move around
space - use tool
Q - switch tools
E - switch seed
LCTRL - plant seed
return - sleep in bed/interact with merchant

I hope you enjoy the game!
